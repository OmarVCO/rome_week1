                <h2>People of Rome</h2>
                <p>Since ancient times, to be a citizen of Rome has been a source of pride. Today there is still considerable prestige in being a Romano di Roma, or “Roman” Roman. Among such Romans are the “black nobility,” families with papal titles who form a society within high society, shunning publicity and not given to great intimacy with the “white nobility,” whose titles were conferred by mere temporal rulers. The inhabitants who consider themselves the most nobly Roman of them all are the people of the Trastevere (“Across the Tiber”) district. In ancient times, Trastevere was the quarter for sailors and foreigners, whereas the founding fathers eastward across the river were soldiers and farmers. From the Middle Ages a number of palaces there were the homes of powerful families.</p>

                <h2>Economy</h2>
                <p>Rome cannot be called an industrial city, although it has a fair amount of medium and light industries. Among these have been the engineering, electronics, and chemical industries, as well as printing, clothing manufacture, and food processing. Factories have been located mostly in the northwestern part of the city, but many closed or relocated during the 1980s and 90s. The construction industry remains important.</p>
